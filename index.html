                <h3>Hello, I'm Jitendra Raghav.</h3>
                <p>
                    I am a 20-year-old aspiring developer from the small village of Sultanpur Bilauni in Uttar Pradesh, India. My world changed when I discovered coding; it felt like unlocking a superpower that could bring ideas to life. I spend every spare moment learning, driven by a deep passion to build applications that can solve real-world problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, my gateway to this world is an old HP Pavilion G4 laptop. While I am incredibly grateful for it, its age and limitations are now a major roadblock. It struggles to run the modern development tools, compilers, and emulators that are essential for me to grow my skills and build more complex projects.

                To take the next leap in my journey, I need a more capable machine. My goal is to raise <strong>$342</strong> to purchase a reliable, second-hand laptop that can handle the demands of modern coding.
